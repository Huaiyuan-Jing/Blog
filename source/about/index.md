Hey! I'm Huaiyuan Jing, a Computer Science and Math student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. You could say I have a split personality: one part of me loves building AI, and the other is fascinated by the weird world of quantum computing.

On the AI side, I've spent time building a deep learning library from the ground upâ€”think of it as a baby PyTorch, raised without using the usual cheat codes like Numpy. I've also developed a tool to drag old, dusty Python 2 code into the modern era, which apparently saves a ton of time and money.

When I'm not doing that, I'm working with quantum computers. I've dabbled in everything from Shor's and Grover's algorithms to figuring out how to make these sensitive machines less prone to errors.

For fun, I compete in programming contests, which is basically a fancy way of saying I enjoy solving really hard puzzles under extreme time pressure. I even managed to snag a gold medal at the ICPC regionals, so I guess I'm not too bad at it.

Basically, I love a good challenge, whether it's building an AI brain or telling a quantum bit what to do.

And if you use Linux in your daily life, tell me about your favourite distro in the comment. I believe it is better than MBTI to show someone's personality. Maybe we can become friends. I use Fedora, BTW.
