Hey! I'm HackThink. I'm here to share my pride and prejudice with anyone who wants to waste their time on me.

And if you use Linux in your daily life, tell me about your favourite distro in the comment. I believe it is better than MBTI to show someone's personality. Maybe we can become friends. I use Fedora, BTW.
